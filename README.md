# 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
This project is to assess the coding abilities and style of an applicant for the role of Perl Developer
within the team at MyDesktop

Two Sample data files, one CSV and the other is XML have been provided as the input to the process.

A MySQL CREATE TABLE script has also been included. The table should be created from this script and
the data loaded into it as the outcome of the process. The process should also write a summary to
standard output (eg lines read; rows inserted; errors encountered).

# 2. SCOPE
Create a function, program (or programs) in Perl that will take files in the supplied formats and returns output in the
format specified. Note that files with different content may be provided for testing.

You are allowed be as minimalistic and/or creative as you wish.  Feel free to use any framework as long as the requirements are specified, and we can run the code to test it.

# 3. INPUT FILE FORMATS
Two input data files will be provided for this test. Both of these files contain similar data in terms of the information. However the XML file contains additional information that is not required for the output side of this project.

 * users_list.csv
 * users_list.xml

# 4. OUTPUT FORMAT
The primary outcome of the test is to ingest/update the data from the files into the database table.

As an additional option, you may wish to output a pipe delimited text file, or you can create web page where you can upload file and get output on html pages.  There is no hard guideline for this, you can be as creative as you want.

# 5. ASSUMPTIONS
  * We don't need to buy or install any external software. your code should work with minimum requirements
  * It is expected that the applicant will provision their own development environment
