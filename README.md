# 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
This project is to assess the coding abilities and style of an applicant for the role of Perl Developer
within the team at MyDesktop

Two Sample data files, one CSV and the other is XML have been provided as the input to the process.

A MySQL CREATE TABLE script has also been included. The table should be created from this script and
the data loaded into it as the outcome of the process. The process should also write a summary to
standard output (eg lines read; rows inserted; errors encountered).

# 2. SCOPE
Create a program (or programs) in Perl that take files in the supplied formats and returns output in the
format specified. Note that files with different content may be provided for testing.

however this is not limited to just this program. You are allowed be creative and create webpage or use any framework as long as we can run the code and test it.
You are also allowed to use any framework if you wish.

# 3. INPUT FILE FORMATS
Two input data files will be provided for this test. Both of these files contain similar data in terms of the information. However the XML file contains additional information that is not
required for the output side of this project.

 * users_list.csv
 * users_list.xml

# 4. OUTPUT FORMAT
The outcome of the process should be the data ingest/update into the database table.
As an additional option, you may wish to output a pipe delimited text file with one record per line as seperated by `|`
or you can create web page where you can upload file and get output on html pages
There is no hard guideline for this. you can be as creative as you can.

# 5. ASSUMPTIONS
  * we don't need to buy or install any external software. your code should work with minimum requirements
  * It is expected that the applicant will provision their own development environment.
